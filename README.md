# Unity-Bartender-Game
This is my first game project. Still working on it. I used blender for models and animations, unity as a game engine and of course C# for coding.
here are the Scripts, Animations folders of current and unfinished version of my mobile bartender game project.
some of the scripts are not completed, some of them were just a test and dont necessary, and the game is about %70 finisihed.
