# Unity-Bartender-Game
This is my first game project. Still working on it. I used blender for models and animations, unity as a game engine and of course C# for coding.
here are the Scripts, Animations folders of current and unfinished version of my mobile bartender game project.
some of the scripts are not completed, some of them were just a test and dont necessary, and the game is about %70 finisihed.


here is a short video of the current unfinished verison of my project:

In this game, player will be a bartender and his main purpose is preparing the orders as correctly and fast as possible.
The time is ticking and player must be fast and correct to earn money and tips from customers.
To achieve this, player must memorise recipes of the cocktails over time. But of course, a recipe book is always there to help.
Here are some screenshots from unity
